## Projects & Initiatives  

### Sustainability by Tech   
This initiative transforms e-waste donations and community partnerships into maker spaces for children.  

**Why it matters:** Many children from underprivileged schools receive their first computer through these hubs. This gives them a new chance for learning and innovation.

**Impact so far:**  
- The first hub was launched in Uganda, where students created a food dehydrator for tomatoes. This project was selected as a finalist in the Zayed Sustainability Prize. 

- The initiative is expanding to the Philippines, where new hubs are being built in schools so rural students have to paddle across a river to get there! 

**How it works:** We hold donation drives, collect monitors, PCs, laptops, tools, craft supplies, and more. We bring these to under-funded schools to create maker spaces and tech rooms. Older students act as mentors, younger students learn from them, and together they create meaningful projects that make a lasting impact in their communities.  

## Education & Skills
